Smart watch for developers  
Under Development

  The project basically is a smartwatch for developers which is run-time programmable. It is equipped with a touch display, 1 esp8266 12E micro-controller, 1 atmega328p micro-controller as basic hardware and some passive and active components.
   In this project I aimed at creating 3 basic functionalities:
1. Run-time programming capability.
3. Inbuilt measuring tools for developers.
4. Stacking Capability.  
 Why these functionalities:
  As a developer i like to program my developer boards on the go, so i developed a markup programing language and UI for touch based micro-controller programming .
  The system is equipped with an inbuilt multi-meter designed by me capable of measuring resistance, capacitance, inductance and voltage.
  A single micro-controller alone provides limited number of IO pins and processing speed. But by stacking micro-controllers (I2C protocol)  those limitations can be reduced.
